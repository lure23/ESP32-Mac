# ESP32/Rust on macOS

Getting started with ESP32 Rust development, using macOS host (for IDE) and a Multipass VM (other tooling).

>Note: This repo builds upon [ESP32 on WSL](https://github.com/lure23/ESP32-WSL) (Windows and WSL; esp-idf; C/C++)
>
>If you are interested in using WSL instead of Multipass, check that repo together with this. Also, you can attach the ESP32 dev board directly to the Mac, but this use case isn't covered in this repo, yet. <!-- #whisper (mostly because there's no good open source USB/IP server for macOS and Multipass doesn't have USB device management, unlike other VM solutions). -->

<!-- tbd. eventually, a schematics picture on how it all falls in
- USB server (usbipd, driver)
- host (IDE)
- Multipass (Rust, Cargo)
- folder sharing
-->

## Aim üçè‚õìÔ∏è

- Minimal software installs on the host (Mac)
- Ability to flash <!--(and later, debug)--> the device from within Multipass VM

**Focus**

- RISC V only

   >If you want Xtensa-based chips covered, please sign up as a co-author. :)

- [Embassy](https://embassy.dev) async development

   Embassy is a *generational shift* in embedded programming, like Node.js was for cloud backends.

- Only stable Rust

	All ESP32 (RISC V) Rust development should be possible using the stable Rust (Jun'24). Documentation online still tells otherwise, but it may be either a) outdated and/or b) refer to Xtensa chip variants.

	<!-- disabled; keep for now
	>*Furthermore, for ESP32-C3, a nightly version of the Rust toolchain is currently required, for this training we will use nightly-2023-11-14 version.* <sub>[Embedded Rust (no_std) on Espressif](https://docs.esp-rs.org/no_std-training/02_2_software.html)
	-->

## Requirements

- Mac with:
   - [Multipass](https://multipass.run) installed

- Windows computer (Win10 Home is enough)
   - [`usbipd-win`](https://github.com/dorssel/usbipd-win) 4.2.0 (or later) installed

      >Note: A Linux computer would do just as well, and the author plans to *eventually* provide guidance on using a Raspberry Pi for this USB hosting. You can probably set such up on your own, with basic Linux knowledge and adapting this guide.

   - `CP210x universal Windows driver` (11.3.0) installed from [CP210x USB to UART Bridge VCP Drivers](https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers) (SiLabs)

	
### Embedded hardware

The intention is to support as many common ESP32 (RISC V) development boards as possible. If you have access to boards not listed below, please consider giving a PR and/or becoming a co-author to the repo. 

**Warning!!**

*When powering the ESP32 boards for the first time, <font color=dark>**BEWARE OF THE STRONG LED LIGHT!!**</font> The author used a tape on top, until he reflashed the device. üòéü©π*

`[1]`: version *physically printed* on the back side of the circuit board.

`[2]`: revision listed when running `espflash board-info` or restarting a board. This matters to some functionality, e.g. for C3 boards JTAG functionality is available for chip revisions >= 0.4. Note that when earlier documentation and bootloaders mention chip revisions "3" and "4", they mean 0.3 and 0.4 (ESP-IDF 5.0 onwards).
</small>

#### Board specific notes

**ESP32-C6-DevKitM-01**

The dev board has two USB ports:

![](.images/devkitm-1-ports.png)

Ideally, one could use either of these to reach the device, but in practice there are differences.

*tbd. Explain the differences*

For now, **connect the cable to the "left"** (`uart`) port. This way, the default settings of `esp-hal` (we'll get there soon) will allow `println` messages to be see on the VM terminal.


<!-- 
Developed on:

Mac:
- macOS 14.5 (Intel)
- Multipass 1.13.1
- (CP210x device driver v. 6.0.2 optional; if running on single computer)

Windows:
- Windows 10 Home
   - CP210x universal Windows driver (11.3.0)
- usbipd-win v. 4.2.0
- WSL version 2.1.5.0 (> wsl --version); Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS ($ lsb_release -a)
-->


## Prepare

### USB/IP sharing

- Set up USB/IP sharing according to instructions in the [ESP32-WSL](https://github.com/lure23/ESP32-WSL?tab=readme-ov-file#steps-set-up-usb-ip-bridging) (ignore the WSL parts of it).

	You should have:
	
	- `usbipd bind` exposing the dev board to the network
	- IP of the computer doing the sharing

### Multipass VM

We use a Multipass VM to keep the Rust development toolchain away from your main account. This is similar to using a dockerized workflow for development.

- Study the [`mp`](https://github.com/akauppi/mp) repo in detail!

	- Create the `rust-emb` instance within it.

### Work folder

We'll clone [`esp-rs/esp-hal`](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal) since it has good examples to see that the development toolchain works (before going to Embassy).

Within the host:

- In folder of your choice:

   ```
   $ git clone -depth 1 git@github.com:esp-rs/esp-hal.git
   ...

	$ multipass stop rust-emb
	$ multipass mount --type=native esp-hal rust-emb:/home/ubuntu/esp-hal
	```

	The `esp-hal` folder now resides on your host, but can be accessed from the VM.

>Note: Mounting with `--type=native` provides "better performance" than default MP mounts, but requires the VM to be switched off while changes to the mounts are made. 	


### Connecting the device to Multipass

We presume you have the USB/IP server running, and know the IP of the  machine (`192.168.1.29` below - replace with yours).

```
$ multipass shell rust-emb
```

>The following commands are to be given in the `rust-emb` VM.

1. Check that you can see the dev board (optional)

	```
   $ usbip list -r 192.168.1.29
	```

## Run some examples from `esp-hal`

>**Background**: The [esp-hal](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal) repo (Hardware Abstraction Layer) has code that allows using the ESP32 hardware from Rust. It includes also an `examples` folder that we'll look into.


### Clone

Let's clone the [`esp-hal`](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal) repo to your host (Mac):

```
$ git clone --depth 1 git@github.com:esp-rs/esp-hal.git
```

>`--depth 1` excludes history; we don't need it and same some disk space

### Share the folder with VM

```
$ multipass stop rust-emb
$ multipass mount --type=native esp-hal rust-emb:/home/ubuntu/esp-hal
```

>Note: We don't need to enter the `esp-hal` folder on the host side. Just sharing it with the VM.

<!-- disabled (too much)
<p />

>Warn: The size of the folder becomes around 1.9GB (try `du -h -d1 .`). This author prefers having such large folders on the host side. Your call, though.
-->

Now you have `esp-hal` available within the VM. 

>Note: Unfortunately, using `--type=native` requires the VM to be shut down when adding/removing mounts. On the other side, it promises better performance than default Multipass mounts.

### Restart the VM

```
$ multipass shell rust-emb
```

Within the VM, re-attach the development kit. It was lost when we restarted the VM.

```
$ sudo usbip attach -r 192.168.1.29 -b 3-1
```

### Build

Within the VM:

```
$ cd esp-hal
```

>Study the [`esp-hal/examples/`](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal/tree/main/examples/) folder. 
>
>This is a treasure trove of dealing with different sensors. To begin with, we just build (and run) the `hello_world` to see connection to the development board would work.

<!-- tbd...?
-- here about editing `Cargo.toml` **IF** this helps with the console output:
   
#esp-println         = { path = "../esp-println", features = ["log"] }  // WAS 2-Jun-24
esp-println         = { path = "../esp-println", default-features=false, features = ["log", "jtag-serial", "defmt-espflash"] }
-->

Within the `esp-hal` folder in the VM:

```
$ cargo xtask run-example esp-hal esp32c6 hello_world
```

Did the sample run?

```
    CTRL+R    Reset chip
    CTRL+C    Exit
```

Not sure. It seems the development board works, but we don't see `Hello world!` anywhere. <sub>[source](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal/blob/main/examples/src/bin/hello_world.rs#L38)</sub>

<font color=orange>*tbd. Figure out why the output doesn't reach the host terminal.*</font>

### More samples

To see which samples are suitable for e.g. `esp32-c6`: 

```
$ git grep -P "(?<=% CHIPS:).*esp32c6" examples/src/
```

That gives 82 matches! üòÉ

<!-- 
### ADC
...
-->

<!-- tbd. Doesn't blink the *internal* LED; fix that?
### Blinky üö®

Leaving the lack of `println` visibility behind, let's check:

```
$ cargo xtask run-example esp-hal esp32c6 blinky
```

-->

## Embassy!

**tbd.**

The main `loop` of the `blinky` application does busy-looping. It keeps the CPU running all the time.

By moving to [Embassy](https://embassy.dev) we can solve that for good!




<!-- bring back, IF we get things to work... tbd.
## Outcome

We have set up the development tools fully within Multipass. On the Mac side, there's nothing that needs to be installed.

Unfortunately, we weren't able to get the `usbipd` server running properly on macOS, but that may change over the years. Also - you may look into commercial or closed source solutions, if you don't wish to pitch in the extra PC.

The author is rather pleased about the arrangement, though. This is enough to let him proceed with the rest of the toolchain setup - see [EmbeddedRover](https://github.com/lure23/EmbeddedRover) for more.

And - there's still 10 minutes of 2023 remaining. 

Happy üéâ
New Year
Everyone!

Make great things!

## Q/A & Hints

### How does `probe-rs` find a development board?

>Note the `303a:1001` in e.g. the `lsusb` output. These are the "vendor id" and "product id" of your board. 

They match a line in the `udev` rules file used by `probe-rs`:

### How to make the VM more performant?

You can increase the number of cores Multipass is allowed to use by:

- `multipass stop rust-emb`
- `multipass set local.rust-emb.cpus={X}`

Then `multipass shell rust-emb` to get back in action.
