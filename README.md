# ESP32/Rust on macOS

Instructions on how to set up an ESP32 Rust development toolchain, using macOS host (for IDE) and a Multipass VM (other tooling).

The explicit (and only) target is [Embassy](https://embassy.dev) development.

>Note: This repo builds upon [ESP32 on WSL](https://github.com/lure23/ESP32-WSL) (Windows and WSL; esp-idf; C/C++)
>
>If you are interested in using WSL instead of Multipass, check that repo together with this. Also, you can attach the ESP32 dev board directly to the Mac, but this case isn't covered (yet). Let the author know if the arrangement of two repos feels uncomfortable.

<!-- tbd. eventually, a schematics picture on how it all falls in
- USB server (usbipd, driver)
- host (IDE)
- Multipass (Rust, Cargo)
- folder sharing
-->

## Aim üçè‚õìÔ∏è

- Minimal software installs on the host (Mac)
- Ability to flash the device from within Multipass VM
- RISC V only 

   <!--#whisper If you want to contribute as a co-host, maintaining the Xtensa architecture, let the author know.-->

<!-- #later???
- Ability to develop with a host-side IDE
	- ..including debugging
-->

### No nightlies needed!

The repo only handles workflows on stable Rust. Needing to use `nightly` is unfortunately out of the scope.

>*Furthermore, for ESP32-C3, a nightly version of the Rust toolchain is currently required, for this training we will use nightly-2023-11-14 version.* <sub>[Embedded Rust (no_std) on Espressif](https://docs.esp-rs.org/no_std-training/02_2_software.html)

This might not hold any more, but the above text is there (2-Jun-24). Is it true? If so, C3 is ruled out.


## Requirements

- Mac with
   - [Multipass](https://multipass.run) installed

   <!-- disable?
   - `rust-emb` development VM running from [`mp`](https://github.com/akauppi/mp) (GitHub) -->

- Windows computer (Win10 Home is enough)
   - [`usbipd-win`](https://github.com/dorssel/usbipd-win) 4.2.0 (or later) installed

   >Note: A Linux computer would do just as well, and the author would like to *eventually* provide guidance on using a Raspberry-Pi for this USB hosting. You can probably set such up on your own, with basic Linux knowledge and adapting from this guide.

   - `CP210x universal Windows driver` (11.3.0) installed from [CP210x USB to UART Bridge VCP Drivers](https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers) (SiLabs)

	>*Note: This may not be needed for ESP32-C6 development, only ESP32-C3.*

**Alternatives**

If you don't want to use a separate PC/Raspberry Pi for USB hosting, but are ready to connect the ESP32 devkit directly to your mac, there are [some instructions](...). <font color=orange>*tbd.*</font>

>TL;DR: You'll need to:
- install `CP210x` driver on the Mac
- run a USB/IP server on the Mac (*not* available as open source) **or** use a virtualization product

<p/>

>Note that physically separating the devkit from your (main?) computer has the added benefit that if something goes haywire with - say - your solderings, you are not jeopardising your main computer. This is why the author prefers this two-machine solution.

## Prepare

### Setting up USB/IP sharing

- See [ESP32-WSL](https://github.com/lure23/ESP32-WSL?tab=readme-ov-file#steps-set-up-usb-ip-bridging) (GitHub).

	Mark down the IP of the machine (Windows or Linux) providing USB/IP bridging.


### Launching Multipass VM

- See [`mp`](https://github.com/akauppi/mp) (GitHub) and have the `rust-emb` VM running.


### Connecting the device to Multipass

We presume you have the USB-to-IP server running, and know the IP of the intermediate machine (`192.168.1.29` below - replace with yours).

The following commands are to be given in the `rust-emb` VM:

1. Check that you can see the dev board (optional)

	```
   $ usbip list -r 192.168.1.29
	```
	
	<details><summary>**ESP32-C3-DevKitC-02 v.1.1**</summary>

   ```
   Exportable USB devices
   ======================
    - 192.168.1.29
           3-1: Silicon Labs : CP210x UART Bridge (10c4:ea60)
              : USB\VID_10C4&PID_EA60\BC2F214F809DED11AAFA5F84E259FB3E
              : (Defined at Interface level) (00/00/00)
              :  0 - Vendor Specific Class / unknown subclass / unknown protocol (ff/00/00)
   ```
   </details>

	<details><summary>**ESP32-C6-DevKitM-1 v.1.0**</summary>

   ```

	           : USB\VID_303A&PID_1001\54:32:04:07:15:10
	           : Miscellaneous Device / ? / Interface Association (ef/02/01)
	           :  0 - Communications / Abstract (modem) / None (02/02/00)
	           :  1 - CDC Data / unknown subclass / unknown protocol (0a/02/00)
	           :  2 - Vendor Specific Class / Vendor Specific Subclass / unknown protocol (ff/ff/01)
	```
	</details>
   
2. Attach the dev board to your VM

   ```
   $ sudo usbip attach -r 192.168.1.29 -b 3-1
   ```

3. Now you should see it in the device tree:

   ```   
   $ lsusb
   ```
   
	<details><summary>**ESP32-C3-DevKitC-02 v.1.1**</summary>

	```

   Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
   ```
	</details>
	
	<details><summary>**ESP32-C6-DevKitM-1 v.1.0**</summary>

	```
	Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
	Bus 001 Device 003: ID 303a:1001 Espressif USB JTAG/serial debug unit
	Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
	```
	</details>

4. Check with `probe-rs`

	>Haven't gotten this working with the `ESP32-C3-DevKitC-02`, so needing to abandon that target, for now. <!--tbd. Create an issue, then mention here!!!-->
	
	<details><summary>**ESP32-C6-DevKitM-1 v.1.0**</summary>

	```
	$ probe-rs list
	The following debug probes were found:
	[0]: ESP JTAG -- 303a:1001:54:32:04:07:15:10 (EspJtag)
	```
	</details>


## Run some examples from `esp-hal`

>**Background**: The [esp-hal](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal) repo (Hardware Abstraction Layer) has code that allows using the ESP32 hardware from Rust. It includes also an `examples` folder that we'll look into.


### Clone

Let's clone the [`esp-hal`](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal) repo to your host (Mac):

```
$ git clone --depth 1 git@github.com:esp-rs/esp-hal.git
```

>`--depth 1` excludes history; we don't need it and same some disk space

### Share the folder with VM

```
$ multipass stop rust-emb
$ multipass mount --type=native esp-hal rust-emb:/home/ubuntu/esp-hal
```

>Note: We don't need to enter the `esp-hal` folder on the host side. Just sharing it with the VM.

<!-- disabled (too much)
<p />

>Warn: The size of the folder becomes around 1.9GB (try `du -h -d1 .`). This author prefers having such large folders on the host side. Your call, though.
-->

Now you have `esp-hal` available within the VM. 

>Note: Unfortunately, using `--type=native` requires the VM to be shut down when adding/removing mounts. On the other side, it promises better performance than default Multipass mounts.

### Restart the VM

```
$ multipass shell rust-emb
```

Within the VM, re-attach the development kit. It was lost when we restarted the VM.

```
$ sudo usbip attach -r 192.168.1.29 -b 3-1
```

### Build

Within the VM:

```
$ cd esp-hal
```

>Study the [`esp-hal/examples/`](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal/tree/main/examples/) folder. 
>
>This is a treasure trove of dealing with different sensors. To begin with, we just build (and run) the `hello_world` to see connection to the development board would work.

<!-- tbd...?
-- here about editing `Cargo.toml` **IF** this helps with the console output:
   
#esp-println         = { path = "../esp-println", features = ["log"] }  // WAS 2-Jun-24
esp-println         = { path = "../esp-println", default-features=false, features = ["log", "jtag-serial", "defmt-espflash"] }
-->

Within the `esp-hal` folder in the VM:

```
$ cargo xtask run-example esp-hal esp32c6 hello_world
```

Did the sample run?

```
    CTRL+R    Reset chip
    CTRL+C    Exit
```

Not sure. It seems the development board works, but we don't see `Hello world!` anywhere. <sub>[source](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal/blob/main/examples/src/bin/hello_world.rs#L38)</sub>

<font color=orange>*tbd. Figure out why the output doesn't reach the host terminal.*</font>

### More samples

To see which samples are suitable for e.g. `esp32-c6`: 

```
$ git grep -P "(?<=% CHIPS:).*esp32c6" examples/src/
```

That gives 82 matches! üòÉ

<!-- 
### ADC
...
-->

<!-- tbd. Doesn't blink the *internal* LED; fix that?
### Blinky üö®

Leaving the lack of `println` visibility behind, let's check:

```
$ cargo xtask run-example esp-hal esp32c6 blinky
```

-->

## Embassy!

**tbd.**

The main `loop` of the `blinky` application does busy-looping. It keeps the CPU running all the time.

By moving to [Embassy](https://embassy.dev) we can solve that for good!




<!-- bring back, IF we get things to work... tbd.
## Outcome

We have set up the development tools fully within Multipass. On the Mac side, there's nothing that needs to be installed.

Unfortunately, we weren't able to get the `usbipd` server running properly on macOS, but that may change over the years. Also - you may look into commercial or closed source solutions, if you don't wish to pitch in the extra PC.

The author is rather pleased about the arrangement, though. This is enough to let him proceed with the rest of the toolchain setup - see [EmbeddedRover](https://github.com/lure23/EmbeddedRover) for more.

And - there's still 10 minutes of 2023 remaining. 

Happy üéâ
New Year
Everyone!

Make great things!

## Q/A & Hints

### How does `probe-rs` find a development board?

>Note the `303a:1001` in e.g. the `lsusb` output. These are the "vendor id" and "product id" of your board. 

They match a line in the `udev` rules file used by `probe-rs`:

```
$ cat /etc/udev/rules.d/69-probe-rs.rules | grep 303a | grep 1001
ATTRS{idVendor}=="303a", ATTRS{idProduct}=="1001", MODE="660", GROUP="plugdev", TAG+="uaccess"
```

### How to make the VM more performant?

You can increase the number of cores Multipass is allowed to use by:

- `multipass stop rust-emb`
- `multipass set local.rust-emb.cpus={X}`

Then `multipass shell rust-emb` to get back in action.
